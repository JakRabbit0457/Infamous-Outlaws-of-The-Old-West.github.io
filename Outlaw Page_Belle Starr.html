<p>Myra Maybelle Shirley Reed Starr or “Belle Starr” was a notorious female American outlaw who was active<br>
in the Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma) from around  1874 to 1889. From her relationships with other<br>
popular outlaws such as Jesse James, Frank James, and Cole Younger of the James-younger gang, her skill as a<br>
formidable sharp-shooter and in riding sidesaddle, her reputation as an outlaw, and her unsolved and violent<br>
murder in 1889, Belle Starr is cemented in history as an infamous outlaw of the Old West, her reputation having<br>
gained her the title of the “Bandit Queen”.

<h2>Early life:</h2>

<p>Myra Maybelle Shirley was born on February 5th, 1848 on her fathers farm in Jasper County near Carthage, Missouri.<br>
Her father John R. Shirley was the “black sheep” of a prosperous and well-off Virginia family and he had married<br>
and divorced twice before he married Myra’s mother Elizabeth Pennington. On his farm He prospered raising horses,<br>
hogs, corn, and wheat. Myra’s mother Elizabeth Pennington Shirley–who was 20 years younger than John–was a relative<br>
of the notorious Hatfield family of the Hatfield-McCoy feud. In 1856 John Shirley would sell the farm and the family<br>
would move to Carthage where they owned an inn, a blacksmith shop, livery stable, and a tavern in town.</p>

<p>As a kid, Myra attended and graduated Missouri's Carthage Female Academy (which her father had helped found)<br>
where she obtained a classical education and became a competent piano player. In her free time she liked the outdoors<br>
and roaming the countryside with her older brother John Allison Shirley or “Bud” who taught her how to ride horseback<br>
and handle guns. During her time in Missouri Myra would become childhood friends with Cole Younger.</p>

<p>The family was quite financially successful for a couple of years, with John Shirley’s place as a respected member<br>
of the town and their owning of businesses on town square bringing in the money to support their lives. This all changed<br>
 however with the breakout of the Civil War in 1861 and the Kansas Missouri Border War (the Bleeding Kansas era), which<br>
saw raids in their town of Carthage by “Jayhawkers” and “Red Legs” and lead to the death of her brother Bud,  who had<br>
become a Jasper County “Bushwhacker” and fought for the confederate side before he was killed by Union militia in Sarcoxie,<br>
Missouri in June of 1864. Myra's parents were supportive of the Confederacy so their businesses were heavily affected by<br>
the raids. With a son dead and their businesses in shambles, the family moved to a farm in Scyene, Texas for a fresh start.</p> 

<p>During this time the James-Younger gang including Jesse and Frank James along with Myra’s childhood friend from Missouri,<br> Cole Younger, would take refuge at Myra’s home farm after fleeing from the law. Myra’s hospitality and aiding along with Cole<br>
knowing her would make her an associate of the gang and from that point on Myra would associate with other outlaw bands who<br>would take refuge at her home in Texas. Among one of these outlaw bands was Jim Reed (James C. Reed), another childhood<br>
friend of Myra’s from Missouri. The two reacquainted in Texas and soon after they got married on November 1, 1866<br>
they had their first child, a daughter named Rosie Lee who Myra nicknamed “Pearl”.</p>

<p>Sometime before 1874, Myra’s husband Jim Reed turned to a life of crime and had been wanted for murder which<br>
caused the family to move to California were Myra and Jim’s second child was born in 1871: a son named James Edwin<br>
who was called “Eddie”. The family later returned to Texas and in the following years Jim Reed–after being unsuccessful<br>
 with becoming a farmer–joined the Starr clan which was an outlaw Cherokee Family residing in Indian territory<br>
(present day Oklahoma). By 1869–unbothered by her husband's new outlaw reputation–Myra had reportedly become Jim’s<br>
“partner in crime”, thus beginning her life as a full-on outlaw.

<p>In August of 1874 Jim Reed was shot and killed by a Sheriff in Paris, Texas. With her husband's death, Myra would<br>
join the Starr clan and move into the Indian Territory. During this time she would also start going by the name “Belle”
and she would give her two children to her mother Elizabeth to take care of while she continued with her life as an
outlaw. She then married Samuel Starr–a member of the gang–in 1880 and the two settled onto a ranch located along the northern bank of the Canadian River called Younger’s Bend–thought to be named after Cole Younger–where they lived
together. Later in 1883 Belle was charged along with Sam Starr of horse theft. Being brought to the nearby court at Fort Smith, under Judge Isaac C. Parker or the “Hanging Judge” of the U.S Commissioner’s Court at Fort Smith the
two were sentenced to one year in prison on March 8th, 1883. Due to good behavior the two were released after 9 months.</p>


<p>In 1886 Sam Starr was killed in a gunfight by one Officer Frank West. With Sam’s death, Belle would then start<br>
living with one of his relatives, Jim July Starr or “Bill July”. The two soon married each other under common-law<br>
and Belle entered into a more quiet chapter of her life, announcing her home as no longer a place welcome for outlaws<br>
and though being a suspect for small crimes in the area, she was not convicted of anything during this time.</p>

<p>Then on February 3rd, 1889 while riding back to her ranch from a neighbors house, Belle Starr was ambushed on the<br>
trail and shot two times in the back with a double-barrel shotgun by an unknown assailant. From her death many suspects<br>
were considered including her own husband Jim July Starr, her son Eddie who it was believed could have had a motive due<br>
to Belle beating him with a bullwhip because of him mistreating her horse, her daughter Pearl with a motive from Belle<br>
stepping into and interfering with her marriage, and Edgar J. Watson, who according to Frank “Pistol-Pete” Eaton had<br>
been drunk and shot Belle on her trip home due to her declining a dance with him at a nearby dance.<br>
Watson–whom July believed had killed Belle and was the most likely to have killed her–had been tried for her murder<br>
but in the end was acquitted. No one was ever convicted of Belle’s murder and the case to this day is still unsolved.</p>

<p>Belle Starr was buried at Younger’s Bend, her tombstone engraved with an image of her beloved<br>
horse Venus, a bell, a star, and a poem which is usually attributed to her daughter Pearl who had<br>
paid for the marble headstone of her grave. The poem reads:</p>

<em><p>Shed not for her the bitter tear</p></em>
<em><p>Nor give the heart to vain regret,</p></em>
<em><p>‘Tis but the casket that lies here,</p></em>
<em><p>The gem that fills it sparkles yet.</p></em>

<h2>What made her infamous:</h2>

<p>Despite only having been convicted of one crime in her lifetime as an outlaw–that being the horse<br>
theft with Sam Starr in 1883–, Belle’s outlaw reputation would make her one of the most infamous<br>
outlaws of the old west. Aspects of her reputation and life which lead to her infamy include:</p>

<li>Her violent and unsolved death in 1889</li>

<li>Her connections with famous outlaws and outlaw bands like the James-Younger Gang and Starr clan<br>
along with lesser known outlaws whom she harbored as well over the years</li>

<li>Her defiance of gender norms as a female outlaw</li>

<li>Her multiple marriages with criminals and outlaws over the course of her life</li>

<li>Her skills as an experienced horsewomen who rode side-saddle (being a better rider than most<br>
women and even men of her time)</li>

<li>Being a crack-shot with a gun (though she didn’t participate in gunfights often and used her guns<br>
more for intimidation and threats)</li>

<li>Her involvement in managing and carrying out robberies and outlaw operations<br>
for many differant bands of outlaws</li>

<p>Like other outlaws such as Billy the Kid and Jesse James, Belle Starr’s life would be put into legend<br>
through “dime novels” and other media which would make her even more infamous though would<br>
often exaggerate or sensationalize aspects of her story as an outlaw. Belle Starr's stylish image<br>
would also add to her infamy. The “Bandit Queen” often wore black velvet outfits and feather-<br>
plumed hats, riding side-saddle through towns with her 2 pistols by her side atop her beloved<br>
mare “Venus”. One of these dime novels included the 1889 novel<i> Belle Starr, the Bandit Queen,<br>
or the Female Jesse James</i>by reporter Richard K. Fox which was published after her death<br>
that same year. This novel has been used as a historical reference for many years.</p>

<h2>Her impact in the Old West:</h2>
<p>Belle Starr overall had an impact in the Old West as a notorious female outlaw who harbored other outlaws<br>
seeking refuge for many years in her own home, defied gender norms, and got involved with various criminal<br>
gangs whom she actively organized and planned robberies and operations for, using her wits and education to<br>
help her associates and gain money in turn.</p>
