<p>Samuel Bass was an American outlaw, train robber, and an outlaw gang leader who was active in primarily<br>
Texas along with Western Nebraska from around 1877 to 1878. Being most notorious for robbing San Francisco’s<br>
Union Pacific Railroad gold train in 1877, Sam Bass is noted as “Texas’s Beloved Bandit” and despite his short<br>
career, he is regarded as one of the most infamous outlaws of the Old west.</p>

<h2>Early life:</h2>

<p>Sam Bass was born on July 21st, 1851 on a farm near Mitchel Indiana to parents Daniel Bass and Elizabeth Jane<br>
Sheeks Bass. He was orphaned at the age of either 13 or 14 and moved in with and was raised by his Uncle who was<br>
abusive. He lived with his abusive uncle for 5 years before running away from home in 1869 at the age of either<br>
18 or 19. For about one year or less Sam worked at a sawmill in Rosedale, Mississippi before taking off to Denton,<br>
Texas were he would be employed by Sheriff W.F. Eagan as a farmhand. During this time Sam would spend his time<br> 
milking the cows, helping out with the horses, cutting firewood and doing other farm chores. He would also become<br>
acquainted with the trails and back roads of the Texas area due to his position as a teamster for a short time which<br>
would later help him in his life as an outlaw.</p>

<p>In 1874 Sam would pursue horse racing after leaving Sheriff Eagen and purchasing a mare (which would be known<br>  
as the “Denton Mare”) with his earnings from being a farmhand. After living off the proceeds from his winnings in<br>
horse racing for a couple of years, Sam and his partner Joel W. Collins–whom he’d met through his operations in<br>
horseracing–would earn around $8,000 from cattle driving for ranchers in San Antonio, Texas in 1876. The cattle<br>
driving operation of theirs led them to Nebraska where they sold the cattle. The two would spend and squander<br>
most of their earnings from the job on gambling in the gold rush town of Deadwood In the Black Hills region<br>
of South Dakota. This left the two broke.

<h2>Life as an outlaw:</h2>

<p>In 1877, now broke, Sam Bass along with Collins–after attempting but being unsuccessful with working as<br> 
freighters–would turn to a life of crime; forming an outlaw gang and starting to rob stagecoaches. This would<br>
mark the start of Sam Bass’s life as an outlaw. Then on September 18th that same year Sam Bass and his gang as<br>
a band of six would ride into Big Springs, Nebraska and pull off robbing the Union Pacific Railroad gold train<br>
from San Francisco, making off with $60,000 worth of gold. This heist is notably one of the biggest train robberies<br>
committed in the USA. After the heist and dividing up the loot, the group of six split up into pairs and went off<br> 
in different directions. In the next weeks Sam Bass fled to Texas and was able to disguise himself as a farmer to<br>
evade the law, his partner Joel Collins however would be killed while resisting arrest at Buffalo Station in Kansas. 

<p>In Texas Sam would form a new gang and continue robbing stagecoaches, in 1878 during the spring successfully<br>
holding up four trains 25 miles from Dallas, Texas. These robberies–which actually gave the gang little money–would<br>
leave them to be hunted by a special company of Texas Rangers headed by Captain Junius Peak. Sam and his gang evaded<br>
the pursuing Texas Rangers for 4 months in an event that would be known as the “Bass war” which made the gang legendary<br>
in the Old West. Sam was able to evade the rangers until Jim “Judas” Murphy–a member of his own gang–turned informant<br>
after being threatened by the Texas Rangers who were withholding medical care from his ill father Henderson. Betraying<br>
him, Jim would write to Maj. John B. Jones to help set up an ambush of Sam’s outlaw gang in Round Rock, Texas where they<br>
were planning on robbing the Williamson County Bank.</p>

<p>On July 19th, 1878 while scouting the area around the bank before the heist that day (also joined by Jim Murphy),<br>
Sam Bass and his gang were noticed by Sheriff A. W. Grimes who asked them to turn in their weapons before the gang<br>
promptly shot and killed him. This started off a gunfight in which Sam was wounded while attempting to flee, being<br>
shot by the Texas Rangers Sergeant Richard Ware and George Herold during the fight. The next day Sam was found lying<br>
in a pasture just North of Round Rock. He was brought into custody before dying of his wounds on July 21st which was<br>
the day of his 27th birthday. Sam Bass would be buried in Round Rock, in what is presently known as the Round Rock Cemetery.</p>




<h2>What made him infamous:</h2>

<p>Despite his short career as an outlaw, Sam Bass is considered 
as one of the most infamous outlaws of the Old West.<br>
Aspects of his career and life which made him infamous include:</p>

<li>His daring and successful train and stagecoach robberies in Texas and Nebraska.<br>
Notably, his robbing of the Union Pacific Railroad gold train in 1877. 
</li>

<li>His reputation as a lucky, bold, and cunning outlaw with a Robin Hood-esq image and persona<br> 
due to his defiance of authority, and targeting of more powerful banks and railroads owned by the rich.<br>
He was generally well-liked by common folk at the time and folk lore depicts him as a generous outlaw.</li>

<li>His evasion of the Texas Rangers in 1878 during the “Bass War”</li> 

<li>His final shootout in Round Rock which brought him to his end.</li>

<p>Like other outlaws, after his death the media would solidify his place as a legend of the west through<br> 
dramatic representations and many portrayals in books, shows, films, and songs such as John Denton's<br>
“The Ballad of Sam Bass” which emerged shortly after Sam’s death in 1878.</p>

<h2>His impact in the Old West:</h2>
<p>Sam Bass’s impact in the Old West was overall as an infamous train and stagecoach robber who was well liked<br>
by people in Texas for his Robin Hood-like outlaw persona, gaining him names such as “Texas’s Beloved Bandit” and<br>
“Robin Hood on a Fast Horse”. The town of Round Rock was impacted the most by Sam Bass as the culmination of his<br>
outlaw career in the shootout on July 19th would give a new historical identity for the town and unify it under its<br>distinguishable title as the place where an infamous outlaw was killed. To this day Round Rock has an annual Frontier<br>
Days festival in which the Sam Bass Theatre association performs a reenactment of the Round Rock shootout in 1878.<br>
There are also many roads in Round Rock, Denton, and overall Texas named after Sam and annually on the third Saturday<br>
in July the people of Rosston, Texas celebrate Sam Bass Day.</p>
