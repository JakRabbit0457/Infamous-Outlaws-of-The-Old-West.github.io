<p>William M. “Bill” Doolin was an American outlaw, bandit, and a founder of the notorious “Wild Bunch”<br>
or Doolin-Dalton Gang who was active primarily in Kansas and Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma)<br>
from 1891 to 1896.</p>

<h2>Early life:</h2> 

<p>Bill Doolin was born in Johnson County, Arkansas in 1858 to parents Michael Doolin and Artemina Beller Doolin.<br>
In 1881 Bill left his home in Johnson County where he had been working on his family farm and traveled to Indian<br>
Territory where he became a cowboy, working on the ranch of cattleman Oscar D. Halsell in the “Unassigned Lands"<br>
of the Indian Territory. During this time as a cowboy Bill would meet Emmett Dalton of the later infamous Dalton Gang.<br>
 
<p>On July 4th of 1891 while in the town of Coffeyville in Kansas, Bill would have his first encounter with the law when<br>
a gunfight ensued after him and others were drunk in public and two lawmen tried to confiscate their alcohol. Bill fled<br>
the scene and escaped capture from lawmen. This would be the beginning of Bill Doolin's life as an outlaw.</p>

<h2>Life as an outlaw:</h2> 
<p>Shortly after the shootout in Coffeyville, Bill joined the infamous Dalton Gang; an outlaw gang of brothers Bob, Grat,<br>
and Emmett Dalton (with sometimes Bill Dalton) along with outlaws George “Bitter Creek” Newcomb, Bill Power,<br>
Dick Broadwell, and others who robbed stagecoaches, trains, and banks in Kansas and Indian Territory. Doolin<br>
participated in multiple train robberies during his time with the Dalton Gang including a robbery in Adair,<br>
Leliaetta, and Red Rock.</p>

<p>In October of 1892 the Dalton Gang attempted to rob two banks in Coffeyville but were unsuccessful as they faced<br>
heavy resistance from armed residents of the town and lawmen who rallied together in a shootout against the gang.<br>
By the end of the infamous shootout, four of the five members of the Dalton gang had been killed including Powers,<br>
Broadwell, and Bob and Grat Dalton. Emmett Dalton was the only survivor of the shootout and was captured and<br>
imprisoned. Doolin was not present at Coffeyville for the robberies as that day his horse went lame and so<br>
he didn’t join the heist. However, to some sources it is rumored that he was there that day and was<br>
stationed with the gang’s horses in an alley during the shootout before he escaped.</p>

<p>Later in 1892 Doolin formed a gang of his own known as the Wild Bunch Gang–which included surviving Dalton Gang
member Bill Dalton–and from November of 1892 to March of 1893 Doolin and his gang would rob multiple banks and
trains in Kansas including a bank in Spearville on November 1st of 1892, a train near Cimarron in 1893 and a train
in Caney as well. During this time Doolin also married Edith Ellsworth in the town of Ingalls located in Indian Territory.</p>

<p>Sometime in July of 1893 U.S. Marshal Evett Dumas Nix–who notably served under the jurisdiction of Judge Isaac Parker
of Fort Smith, Arkansas–formed a group known as "The Three Guardsmen” which included U.S Deputy Marshals Henry
Andrew “Heck” Thomas (the leader of the group), William Matthew “Bill” Tilghman Jr., and Chris Madsen. This group
would become determined to bring Doolin and his outlaw gang to an end, beginning a relentless<br>
pursuit against the Wild Bunch Gang that would span about four years in total.</p>

<p>On September 1st that year–after hearing that Doolin’s gang was present in Ingalls–Nix would send a posse of<br>
13 deputy marshals led by Deputy U.S. Marshal John Hixon into the town of Ingalls to confront the infamous gang<br>
in an event known as the Battle of Ingalls. The Battle of Ingalls is recognized by historians as one of the deadliest<br> shootouts between U.S. marshals and outlaws in the Southwest, with six of the fourteen-men posse being either killed or wounded, eight or ten horses killed, and three members of Doolin’s gang being captured. Doolin himself escaped.</p>

<p>By 1895 most of the members of Doolin’s Wild Bunch Gang including Newcomb, Bill Dalton, and Charlie Peirce had been
hunted down and either captured or killed by the Three Guardsmen and subsequent U.S. marshals or bounty hunters who were after the rewards offered for the remaining gang members. With his gang in shambles, Doolin fled to New Mexico Territory
and later headed out to Burden, Kansas where he hid with his wife Edith. Doolin then traveled with Edith to Eureka Springs
in Carroll County, Arkansas to nurse some wounds of his, on January 15th, 1896 being captured and arrested by Bill Tilghman while at the bathhouse there. He later escaped<br>–along with other inmates–from the Guthrie Federal Prison in Indian Territory and found refuge with Edith<br>on a farm in the nearby town of Lawson (now Quay, Oklahoma).</p>

<p>On the night of August 25th that same year, Heck Thomas and a posse of nine deputies arrived at the farm in Lawson where<br> Doolin was hiding out. After Doolin came out of the farm’s barn and Thomas called out for Doolin, Doolin shot at Heck before<br> Heck’s posse then shot and killed him on the spot. Bill Doolin was buried in the Summit View Cemetery in Guthrie, Oklahoma.</p> 

<h2>What made him infamous:</h2>
<p>From his brief role in the famous Dalton Gang and his founding of the Wild Bunch Gang, Bill Doolin is considered as<br>
one of the most infamous outlaws of the Old West. Aspects of Doolin's life as an outlaw which made him infamous include:</p>

<li>His involvement with the Dalton Gang from 1891 to 1892.</li>

<li>His place as the leader of the notorious Wild Bunch Gang, leading multiple<br>
successful bank heists and train robberies over the years in Kansas and other regions.</li>

<li>His role in the Battle of Ingalls in September of 1893 where he and his<br>
outlaw gang faced off against fourteen U.S. Marshals.</li>

<li>His reputation as a clever and quite strategic though dangerous outlaw<br>
who was also skilled at evading capture and usually less violent with his robberies.</li> 

<li>His death in 1896 at the hands of Deputy U.S. Marshal Heck Thomas.</li> 
<p>&nbsp</p>
<h2>His impact in the Old West:</h2>
Bill Doolin's impact in the Old West was overall as a dangerous outlaw and gang leader who robbed trains<br>
and banks in Kansas and Oklahoma (then called Indian Territory). Doolin had a significant impact on the<br>
town of Ingalls as his famous shootout in the town in 1893 made it a historical landmark and cemented<br>
its place in the history and legends of the Old West. He also had a big impact on the history of the U.S.<br>
Marshals of the Old West as his challenge of capture for the Three Guardsmen and their eventual success<br>
in dismantling his gang would add a legendary pursuit to the history of the U.S. Marshals.</p>
